# 2021-GELab-VR Shooter-Bichlmeier

## Roboshoot VR 
The game is a classic VR shooter. You appear as a player in an abandoned office. As soon as you reach for your weapon, which is located on the holster, the game starts. Robots are placed in the room that attack you with their own firearms. In the case of hits by opponents, shield points are deducted from the player. These can only be recharged at randomly distributed charging stations on the map.
